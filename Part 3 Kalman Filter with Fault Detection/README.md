Part 3

* Adding an extra accelerometer to add redundancy to the acceleration signal
* Continuing to fuse both via a Kalman Filter
* Using a Zero Velocity Update algorithm to improve the accelerometer displacement estimation
* Detection of pressure sensor faults
* Detection of accelerometer faults
* Combinations of hardware and software fault detection solutions
* Fault correction, so that a displacement signal is always provided
